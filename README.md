# Exo: An Exoplanet Visualization
Exo is a 3D visualiztion of all of the exoplanets that NASA has discovered. It uses NASA's Exoplanet Archive API to get data on each exoplanet, then calculates their coordinates, color, and size based on that data.

In order to build this project, I used the 3D graphics library three.js along with a custom shader (in order to have points with different sizes). I built it as my capstone project for my Computer Science degree at UC Santa Cruz during the course CMPS 161: Introduction to Data Visualization. The development of the project took about 5 weeks from about mid February to mid/late March of 2019.

You can access Exo [here](https://afiliz.github.io/exo/exo.html), and find info on its controls (as well as a formal 2-column write-up on its development) [here](https://afiliz.github.io/exo/index.html).

I plan on working on this project further as a side-project. [NASA recently updated their exoplanet data API](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/TAP/usingTAP.html), so until I can update Exo to use the new API, it will use non-up-to-date data (the last time it was up-to-date was likely July 2021).

I hope you enjoy Exo!
